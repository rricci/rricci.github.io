      <description>For once on this blog, we are going to talk about a home project ! I discovered quilting not long ago. In my head, quilting was kind of old-fashioned. Quilts were the kind of items you would find in an old family house, dusty, stained and made with weird scraps of flowery fabrics and bedsheets&amp;hellip; But I discovered that there was really something else to it, and you could whip up some gorgeous, modern quilts!</description>
